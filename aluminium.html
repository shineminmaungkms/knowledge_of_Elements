          The history of aluminium was shaped by the usage of its compound alum.
          The first written record of alum was in the 5th century BCE by Greek
          historian Herodotus.[2] The ancients used it as a dyeing mordant, in
          medicine, in chemical milling, and as a fire-resistant coating for
          wood to protect fortresses from enemy arson.

              Aluminium metal was unknown. Roman writer Petronius mentioned in
              his novel Satyricon that an unusual glass had been presented to
              the emperor: after it was thrown on the pavement, it did not break
              but only deformed. It was returned to its former shape using a
              hammer. After learning from the inventor that nobody else knew how
              to produce this material, the emperor had the inventor executed so
              that it did not diminish the price of gold.

          Aluminium is used in a huge variety of products including cans, foils,
          kitchen utensils, window frames, beer kegs and aeroplane parts. This
          is because of its particular properties.

            <li>
              <b>Transportation:</b> Aluminum is used extensively in cars,
              airplanes, bicycles, and even ships because it's lighter than
              other metals without sacrificing strength. This makes it more
              fuel-efficient for vehicles and lighter for aircraft, improving
              their performance and range.
            </li>

              <b>Construction:</b> Aluminum is used in building materials like
              window frames, siding, and roofing due to its durability and light
              weight, which reduces stress on structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Electrical applications:</b> Aluminum is used in power lines,
              cables, and electrical conductors because it's a good conductor of
              electricity. It's also lighter than copper, making it more
              cost-effective for long-distance transmission lines.

            <li>
              Aluminum is one of the lightest metals, making it a popular choice
              for applications where weight is a major concern, such as in
              aircraft, bicycles, and cars. This can lead to improved fuel
              efficiency and performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aluminum is naturally resistant to corrosion, making it a good
              choice for applications that will be exposed to the elements, such
              as building materials, outdoor furniture, and marine equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aluminum is a good conductor of heat and electricity, making it
              useful for applications such as electrical wiring, heat sinks, and
              cookware.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aluminum is one of the most recyclable metals, with a recycling

          It is usually found in minerals such as bauxite and cryolite. These
          minerals are aluminium silicates. Most commercially produced aluminium
          is extracted by the Hall–Héroult process. In this process aluminium
          oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then electrolytically
          reduced to pure aluminium.
