            Nihonium, element number 113 on the periodic table, isn't your
            average chemistry class element. This synthetic element doesn't
            exist naturally on Earth and can only be created in high-tech
            laboratories. With the symbol Nh, it resides in group 13 and boasts
            an impressive atomic number – 113! Unfortunately, its existence is
            fleeting, lasting a mere 10 seconds at best. Despite its short-lived
            nature, nihonium holds scientific significance as a stepping stone
            in understanding the limits of the periodic table and the exotic
            world of superheavy elements.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Born in 2003 and officially recognized in 2015, nihonium's journey
            began with a collaborative effort between Japanese and
            Russian/American scientists. Its name, chosen to honor the land of
            its discovery, reflects Japan's historical name, "Land of the Rising
            Sun." While scientists haven't yet unraveled all its secrets, its
            properties hint at exciting possibilities. Imagine exploring its
            chemical behavior or potential applications in nuclear research –
            that's the realm nihonium beckons us to investigate!
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            So, while you won't find nihonium in your backyard, its existence
            opens doors to a fascinating realm beyond the natural elements. It's
            a testament to human ingenuity and our relentless pursuit of
            knowledge, pushing the boundaries of what we know and paving the way
            for future discoveries in the world of the unseen.

          Nihonium, element 113, is a fleeting celebrity of the periodic table.
          This synthetic heavyweight doesn't grace nature's stage, only
          appearing briefly in labs through high-energy collisions. Born in
          2003, its existence is a testament to scientific collaboration, named
          after the "Land of the Rising Sun" where it was discovered. With a
          symbol of "Nh," this radioactive superstar lives for a mere 10
          seconds, yet its presence opens doors to understanding the limits of
          the periodic table and the exotic world of superheavy elements. So,
          while you won't find it in your pocket, nihonium shines as a beacon of
          human curiosity, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and igniting
          the imagination for future scientific explorations.

          The story of nihonium, element 113, began not with a bang, but with a
          whisper. In 2003, two teams, one Japanese and one Russian-American,
          reported creating this elusive element, but confirmation remained
          years away. Think of it like whispers of a mythical creature echoing
          through the scientific community.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              Finally, in 2012, a Japanese team led by Kosuke Morita solidified
              the whispers into reality. They successfully created nihonium by
              bombarding bismuth with zinc ions, ushering the element onto the
              world stage. But like a fleeting comet, each atom existed for a
              mere 10 seconds before decaying. The confirmation process,
              involving independent teams verifying the discovery, took another
              three years.

              (IUPAC) finally recognized the discovery, awarding priority to the
              Japanese team. The element was officially christened "nihonium," a
              tribute to its birthplace, "Land of the Rising Sun." While
              nihonium remains confined to labs, its discovery marks a giant

          Unfortunately, roentgenium doesn't exist naturally like gold or iron,
          so it doesn't have distinct "sources" in the traditional sense.
          Instead, it's synthesized in highly specialized laboratories using
          powerful machines called particle accelerators. The most common method
          involves bombarding a target atom (like Bismuth) with another element
          (like Nickel) to fuse them into roentgenium. This process creates
          incredibly few atoms, each lasting only milliseconds before decaying
          due to its extreme radioactivity. While there aren't "sources" in the
          usual sense, research facilities like GSI Helmholtz Centre in Germany
          have played a crucial role in creating and studying roentgenium,
          offering a glimpse into this fascinating and fleeting element.
