            Nitrogen, with the symbol N and atomic number 7, is a non-metallic
            element that reigns supreme in Earth's atmosphere. This colorless,
            odorless gas makes up a whopping 78% of the air we breathe, making
            it the most abundant uncombined element. Despite its prevalence in
            the air, it's surprisingly scarce in the solid parts of our planet
            due to the volatility of its compounds.

            Though seemingly unremarkable on its own, nitrogen plays a vital
            role in sustaining life on Earth. It's a fundamental component of
            amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and nucleic acids like
            DNA and RNA, the blueprints of life. Without nitrogen, the complex
            machinery of life as we know it wouldn't exist.

            agriculture to preserving food by preventing spoilage. Its inert
            nature makes it valuable for preventing oxidation and protecting
            sensitive materials. Additionally, liquid nitrogen finds application
            in cryogenics, offering ultra-low temperatures for scientific

          Although nitrogen surrounds us, its existence remained hidden until
          the 18th century. Several scientists, including Daniel Rutherford,
          Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Henry Cavendish, independently contributed
          to its discovery around 1772. They observed a gas remaining after
          removing oxygen and other components from air. While initially called
          "dephlogisticated air" or "foul air," this gas lacked the ability to
          support combustion and life, earning it its negative connotations.

              The journey to identifying nitrogen as a distinct element
              continued. In 1790, Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal proposed the name
              "nitrog√®ne," reflecting its presence in niter (potassium nitrate).
              However, Antoine Lavoisier, recognizing its inert nature,
              suggested "azote," meaning "lifeless" in Greek. While "azote"
              persists in other languages, the English world adopted "nitrogen"
              in 1794, a nod to its role in niter.

          While abundant in the atmosphere (78%), usable nitrogen for various
          purposes comes from diverse sources. Natural fixation by bacteria in
          soil and the root nodules of legumes converts atmospheric nitrogen
          into usable forms for plants. Commercially produced nitrogen often
          originates from the Haber-Bosch process, which combines atmospheric
          nitrogen and hydrogen to create ammonia, a key component of
          fertilizers and other industrial applications. Additionally,
          decomposition of organic matter like animal manure and plant residues
          releases nitrogen back into the environment, contributing to the
          natural nitrogen cycle.
