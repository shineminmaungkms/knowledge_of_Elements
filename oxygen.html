            Oxygen, element symbol O, is a colorless, odorless gas crucial for
            most life on Earth. It makes up about 21% of the atmosphere and
            plays a vital role in cellular respiration, the process by which
            living organisms convert food into energy. Plants release oxygen
            through photosynthesis, creating a natural cycle that sustains life.

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Oxygen is highly reactive, readily forming compounds with other
            elements. This property makes it essential for combustion, where it
            reacts with fuels to release heat and light. Additionally, oxygen is
            used in various industrial processes, including metal purification
            and welding.

          While oxygen has been present in Earth's atmosphere for billions of
          years, its isolation and identification as a distinct element occurred
          much later. Early observations hinted at its existence, but credit for
          its discovery is often shared by two scientists: Carl Wilhelm Scheele
          and Joseph Priestley. Both independently isolated oxygen in the 1770s,
          with Priestley publishing his findings first. However, it was Antoine
          Lavoisier who truly unveiled its significance. He recognized oxygen as
          a fundamental element, named it in 1777, and understood its role in
          combustion, forever changing our understanding of the world.

              individuals to engage in daily activities and exercise with
              greater ease, promoting an overall better quality of life.
            </li>

            <li>
              Low oxygen levels can disrupt sleep patterns and cause fatigue.
              Oxygen therapy can significantly improve sleep quality by ensuring
              proper oxygenation throughout the night, leading to increased
              alertness and energy during the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Studies suggest that sufficient oxygen levels can positively
              impact cognitive function. Oxygen therapy may improve memory,

          The primary source of oxygen on Earth is photosynthesis, a process
          performed by plants and some algae. They utilize sunlight, water, and
          carbon dioxide to produce energy and release oxygen as a byproduct.
          This continuous replenishment sustains the atmospheric oxygen level,
          crucial for most life forms. Additionally, electrolysis of water can
          generate oxygen, though this method is mainly used in industrial
          settings due to its high energy consumption.
