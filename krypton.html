          Krypton's primary source is the Earth's atmosphere, where it exists in
          trace amounts (around 1 part per million). It can be extracted through
          a process called fractional distillation of liquid air, separating it
          from other atmospheric gases. Additionally, nuclear fission in
          reactors produces a specific radioactive isotope of krypton, although
          this is not a commercially viable source for general use.
