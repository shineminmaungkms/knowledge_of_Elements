            Polonium, named after Marie Curie's homeland, Poland, is a rare and
            highly radioactive element. Discovered in 1898, it exists in two
            metallic forms and has no stable isotopes. Though classified as a
            chalcogen, its metallic character aligns it with elements like lead
            and bismuth. Naturally occurring polonium-210, found in trace
            amounts within uranium ores, has a fleeting presence due to its
            short half-life of 138 days.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its rarity, polonium finds limited use in specific
            applications. Its alpha particle emission makes it valuable in
            static eliminators and research instruments. However, its extreme
            radioactivity poses a significant health hazard. Ingestion or
            inhalation of even minute quantities can be fatal, requiring strict
            handling protocols and specialized facilities.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Due to the challenges of extracting polonium from natural sources,
            it's primarily produced by bombarding bismuth with neutrons.
            Nevertheless, its hazardous nature and limited applications restrict
            its widespread use. Alternative solutions are often sought for
            applications where safety and feasibility outweigh polonium's unique
            properties.

          Polonium, with the symbol Po and atomic number 84, is a rare and
          highly radioactive element. Classified as a chalcogen, it shares some
          chemical similarities with selenium and tellurium, but its metallic
          character aligns it more closely with elements like lead and bismuth.
          All its isotopes are unstable, with the naturally occurring
          polonium-210 found in trace amounts within uranium ores having a short
          half-life of 138 days. Despite its radioactivity, polonium finds
          limited applications in specific scientific and industrial settings,

          In 1898, while researching the radioactivity of pitchblende, Marie and
          Pierre Curie stumbled upon a new element exhibiting exceptional
          radioactive properties. Recognizing it as distinct from the known
          element uranium, they named it "polonium" after Marie's native Poland,
          then under foreign rule. This audacious act served as a symbolic
          gesture of national pride and defiance.

          Polonium exists in minute quantities in nature, primarily found as
          traces within uranium ores. However, extracting it from this source is
          impractical due to its extreme rarity. The primary method for
          obtaining polonium today involves bombarding bismuth-209 with neutrons
          in nuclear reactors. This process triggers a decay chain, ultimately
          resulting in the production of polonium-210, the most common isotope.
          Due to its short half-life, polonium requires continuous production to
          meet even limited industrial and research needs.
