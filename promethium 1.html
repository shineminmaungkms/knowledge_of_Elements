            Promethium, element number 61, holds a unique position in the
            periodic table. Unlike its neighbors, it has no stable isotopes and
            exists naturally on Earth only in fleeting traces. This radioactive
            rarity, named after the Titan who defied the gods, is truly a marvel
            of scientific discovery and ongoing research.

          Promethium (Pm), element number 61, is a rare and radioactive oddity.
          Unlike other lanthanides, it has no stable isotopes, existing only in

          In 1902, chemist Bohuslav Brauner prophesied its presence, and decades
          later, Henry Moseley confirmed the missing piece. Yet, capturing this
          elusive element proved trickier than expected. Several teams claimed

          Promethium boasts two unusual sources: cosmic whispers and atomic
          echoes. In trace amounts, it arises from rare alpha decays of natural
          europium and spontaneous uranium fission, leaving behind fleeting
