          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Holmium (Ho), element number 67, is a soft, silver, metal belonging
            to the lanthanide series. While not abundant on Earth, it has some
            unique properties worth noting. In its pure form, it possesses
            asilver,gleam and shows decent resistance to corrosion. Like most of
            its lanthanide cousins, it doesn't like to be alone and readily
            forms a yellowish oxide coating when exposed to air.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Though its applications are limited, holmium boasts some hidden
            talents. It excels at absorbing neutrons, making it valuable in
            nuclear reactors for controlling chain reactions. But here's the
            real kicker: holmium, along with dysprosium, boasts the strongest
            magnetic force of any naturally occurring element, albeit as a
            paramagnet (meaning it needs an external magnetic field to shine).
            Imagine the potential!
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Named after the Swedish capital, holmium's applications are still
            under exploration. Currently, it finds use in some magnets and
            research areas. Scientists are particularly interested in its
            magnetic properties and potential uses in advanced electronics and
            data storage. Maybe someday, a tiny bit of holmium will be quietly
            working its magic in your smartphone!

          Holmium, element number 67, is a rare-earth metal with a silvery
          sheen. While not abundant on Earth, it holds its own within the
          lanthanide series. It's a soft, malleable metal with a unique ability
          to absorb neutrons, making it useful in nuclear reactors. But its real
          claim to fame lies in its magnetic prowess. Boasting the strongest
          magnetic force among naturally occurring elements, holmium's potential
          in advanced electronics and data storage is still being explored. So,
          keep an eye out for this element – it might just be the hidden hero in

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          At standard temperature and pressure, holmium, like many of the second
          half of the lanthanides, normally assumes a hexagonally close-packed
          (hcp) structure. Its 67 electrons are arranged in the configuration
          [Xe] 4f11 6s2, so that it has thirteen valence electrons filling the
          4f and 6s subshells.

          The story of dysprosium begins in 1886, not with grand expeditions but
          in a Parisian lab. French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
          meticulously analyzing erbium ores, stumbled upon an impurity. After
          countless attempts, he isolated a new element, aptly named
          "dysprosium" from the Greek "hard to get at." True to its name,
          extracting pure dysprosium remained a challenge until the 1950s with
          the development of ion-exchange techniques.

              a brown one he named "holmia" (after Stockholm's Latin name) and a
              green one later identified as thulium. Claiming the Prize: Both
              teams had independently discovered holmium, though neither
              obtained a perfectly pure sample. It wasn't until 1911 that pure
              holmia was finally isolated.

              Holmium's journey held one more surprise. Years later, scientists
              realized "pure" holmium still contained traces of another element,
              later named dysprosium. This meant both teams hadn't just
              discovered holmium, but also inadvertently laid the groundwork for
