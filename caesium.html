          In 1860, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the
          mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Because of the bright blue lines
          in the emission spectrum, they derived the name from the Latin word
          caesius, meaning sky-blue. Caesium was the first element to be
          discovered with a spectroscope, which had been invented by Bunsen and
          Kirchhoff only a year previously. To obtain a pure sample of caesium,
          44,000 litres (9,700 imp gal; 12,000 US gal) of mineral water had to
          be evaporated to yield 240 kilograms (530 lb) of concentrated salt
          solution. The alkaline earth metals were precipitated either as
          sulfates or oxalates, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After
          conversion to the nitrates and extraction with ethanol, a sodium-free
          mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated
          by ammonium carbonate. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium form insoluble
          salts with chloroplatinic acid, but these salts show a slight
          difference in solubility in hot water, and the less-soluble caesium
          and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)2PtCl6) were obtained by
          fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate
          with hydrogen, caesium and rubidium were separated by the difference
          in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol. The process yielded 9.2
          grams (0.32 oz) of rubidium chloride and 7.3 grams (0.26 oz) of
          caesium chloride from the initial 44,000 litres of mineral water.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              From the caesium chloride, the two scientists estimated the atomic
              weight of the new element at 123.35 (compared to the currently
              accepted one of 132.9). They tried to generate elemental caesium
              by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride, but instead of a
              metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which "neither
              under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest
              trace of metallic substance"; as a result, they assigned it as a
              subchloride (Cs 2Cl). In reality, the product was probably a
              colloidal mixture of the metal and caesium chloride. The
              electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury
              cathode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under
              the aqueous conditions. The pure metal was eventually isolated by
              the German chemist Carl Setterberg while working on his doctorate
              with Kekulé and Bunsen. In 1882, he produced caesium metal by
              electrolysing caesium cyanide, avoiding the problems with the
              chloride.

              Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in
              research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical
              fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s,
              when it came into use in radio vacuum tubes, where it had two
              functions; as a getter, it removed excess oxygen after
              manufacture, and as a coating on the heated cathode, it increased
              the electrical conductivity. Caesium was not recognized as a
              high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s. Applications
              for nonradioactive caesium included photoelectric cells,
              photomultiplier tubes, optical components of infrared
              spectrophotometers, catalysts for several organic reactions,
              crystals for scintillation counters, and in magnetohydrodynamic
              power generators. Caesium is also used as a source of positive
              ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)

          Since 1967, the International System of Measurements has based the

          International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration
          of 9,192,631,770 cycles at the microwave frequency of the spectral
          line corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine energy
          levels of the ground state of caesium-133. The 13th General Conference
          on Weights and Measures of 1967 defined a second as: "the duration of
          9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the

          mined mostly from pollucite. Caesium-137, a fission product, is
          extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors. It has the largest
          atomic radius of all elements whose radii have been measured or
          calculated, at about 260 picometers.

          Of all elements that are solid at room temperature, caesium is the
          softest: it has a hardness of 0.2 Mohs. It is a very ductile, pale
          metal, which darkens in the presence of trace amounts of oxygen. When
          in the presence of mineral oil (where it is best kept during
          transport), it loses its metallic lustre and takes on a duller, grey
          appearance. It has a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), making it one
          of the few elemental metals that are liquid near room temperature.
          Mercury is the only stable elemental metal with a known melting point
          lower than caesium.In addition, the metal has a rather low boiling
          point, 641 °C (1,186 °F), the lowest of all metals other than mercury.
          Its compounds burn with a blue or violet colour.

          Caesium forms alloys with the other alkali metals, gold, and mercury
          (amalgams). At temperatures below 650 °C (1,202 °F), it does not alloy
          with cobalt, iron, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, tantalum, or
          tungsten. It forms well-defined intermetallic compounds with antimony,
          gallium, indium, and thorium, which are photosensitive. It mixes with
          all the other alkali metals (except lithium); the alloy with a molar
          distribution of 41% caesium, 47% potassium, and 12% sodium has the
          lowest melting point of any known metal alloy, at −78 °C (−108 °F). A
          few amalgams have been studied: CsHg 2 is black with a purple metallic
          lustre, while CsHg is golden-coloured, also with a metallic lustre.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          The golden colour of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of
          light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group
          is descended. For lithium through rubidium this frequency is in the
          ultraviolet, but for caesium it enters the blue–violet end of the
          spectrum; in other words, the plasmonic frequency of the alkali metals
          becomes lower from lithium to caesium. Thus caesium transmits and
          partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours
          (having lower frequency) are reflected; hence it appears yellowish.
