            Californium isn't found naturally on Earth. Instead, it's created in
            nuclear reactors by bombarding other elements with particles. This
            "transuranic" element holds the title of the sixth such creation,
            and boasts one of the highest atomic masses visible to the naked
            eye.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            This silvery-white metal packs a radioactive punch. Californium
            emits intense neutrons, making it useful in portable metal detectors
            and oil well exploration. However, its quick decay (some isotopes
            lasting only minutes) limits its widespread application.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Born in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
            Californium carries the name of its birthplace. While not abundant,
            it finds niche uses in medicine, research, and even space
            exploration. So, next time you gaze at the stars, remember, a bit of
            California might be shining alongside them!

          Californium, element number 98, is a man-made marvel. Unlike most
          elements on the periodic table, it doesn't exist naturally on Earth.
          Instead, it's forged in the fiery hearts of nuclear reactors,
          bombarded into existence from its lighter sibling, curium. This
          silvery-white metal shines brightly with radioactivity, emitting
          powerful neutrons that make it a valuable tool in scientific

          In 1950, amidst the bustling halls of the Lawrence Berkeley National
          Laboratory (then known as the University of California Radiation
          Laboratory), history was made. A team of scientists led by Glenn
          Seaborg, the "father of transuranium elements," ushered in a new
          element: Californium (Cf). Their creation wasn't found amongst Earth's
          rocks and minerals, but rather materialized in the heart of a powerful
          cyclotron, where they bombarded curium-242 with helium ions. This
          atomic alchemy yielded californium-245, initially existing for only 44
          minutes.

              The journey to isolate and identify this new element was arduous.
              Meticulous chemical separations were employed, extracting a mere
              5,000 atoms - a testament to the team's perseverance. Their
              success earned Californium its namesake, honoring the university
              and state where it was born. Later, other isotopes with longer
              half-lives were discovered, paving the way for further
              exploration.

              advancement. It played a crucial role in confirming the existence
              of new transuranium elements and served as a stepping stone to
