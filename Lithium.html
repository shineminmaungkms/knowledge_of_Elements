            Lithium is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number
            3. It is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element in the
            periodic table. It has a silvery-white color and can be cut with a
            knife. It belongs to the group of alkali metals, which are very
            reactive and tend to lose one electron in chemical reactions.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Lithium has many interesting properties and uses. It has the highest
            specific heat capacity of any solid element, which means it can
            absorb a lot of heat without changing its temperature. It is also
            used in batteries, lubricants, medicines, and nuclear fusion.
            Lithium batteries are widely used in electric vehicles, smartphones,
            laptops, and other devices. Lithium lubricants help reduce friction
            and wear in machinery. Lithium medicines are used to treat bipolar
            disorder and depression. Lithium is also a potential fuel for
            nuclear fusion, as it can produce tritium, a radioactive isotope of
            hydrogen.

          Lithium has a melting point of 180.54 C, a boiling point of 1342 C, a
          specific gravity of 0.534 (20 C), and a valence of 1. It is the
          lightest of the metals, with a density approximately half that of
          water. Under ordinary conditions, lithium is the least dense of the
          solid elements. It has the highest specific heat of any solid element.

        <p class="text text-white">
          Lithium has 3 protons and 3 electrons in its nucleus. The protons have
          a positive charge and the electrons have a negative charge. The number
          of protons determines the identity of the element, and the number of
          electrons determines its chemical behavior.

          The history of lithium is a fascinating journey that spans billions of
          years, from its cosmic origins to its pivotal role in modern
          technology. Lithium, the third element on the periodic table, is the
          lightest metal and one of the most abundant elements in the universe.
          It is believed to have been created during the Big Bang, the
          cataclysmic event that gave birth to our universe.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              The discovery of lithium's unique properties dates back to the
              early 19th century. In 1817, the Swedish chemist Johan August
              Arfwedson isolated lithium from the mineral petalite. He named the
              new element "lithion," derived from the Greek word "lithos,"
              meaning "stone."

              Throughout the 19th century, lithium's applications were limited
              due to its rarity and high cost of extraction. However, in the
              20th century, advancements in technology led to the development of
              more efficient methods for lithium extraction and purification.
              This paved the way for its widespread use in various industries.

          lepidolite, spodumene, petalite, and amblygonite. It is also found in
          sea water and in some brines. Lithium is produced by electrolysis of

          As the universe expanded and cooled, lithium condensed into stars and
          galaxies. Over time, these stars underwent nuclear fusion,
          transforming lithium into heavier elements. However, some lithium
          survived these stellar processes and remained dispersed throughout the
          cosmos.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          Fast forward to the formation of our solar system, approximately 4.6
          billion years ago. The remnants of lithium from the early universe
          were incorporated into the protoplanetary disk, the swirling cloud of
          gas and dust from which the planets formed. As the planets coalesced,
          lithium became concentrated in certain regions, particularly in the
          rocky inner planets, including Earth.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          On Earth, lithium is primarily found in igneous rocks, formed from the
          solidification of molten magma. These rocks are often found in areas
          with high geothermal activity, such as volcanic regions. Lithium is
          also present in seawater, albeit in very low concentrations.

          temperature. This makes it useful for thermal management in devices
          such as batteries, laptops, and electric vehicles. Lithium also has a
          low density, which makes it lighter than air. It can float on water
          and oil, but it reacts violently with both.

          Lithium has many applications in science and technology, thanks to its
