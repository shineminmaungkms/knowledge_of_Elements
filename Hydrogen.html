            Hydrogen is the most abundant and simplest element. Hydrogen occurs
            naturally on earth in compound form with other elements in liquids,
            gases, or solids. Hydrogen combined with oxygen is water (H2O).
            Hydrogen combined with carbon forms different compounds—or
            hydrocarbons—that are found in natural gas, coal, and petroleum.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Hydrogen is currently used in industrial processes, as rocket fuel,
            and in fuel cells for electricity generation and powering vehicles.
            Operators of several natural gas-fired power plants are exploring
            the use of hydrogen to supplement or replace natural gas.

          Hydrogen, the first element on the periodic table, holds a unique
          position in the realm of chemistry. Its identity is defined by its
          fundamental properties and characteristics, which set it apart from
          all other elements. Hydrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol H
          and atomic number 1. It is the lightest element and, at standard
          conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2.

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          Hydrogen atoms consist of a single proton in the nucleus, orbited by a
          single electron. This simple atomic structure makes hydrogen the
          lightest and most abundant element in the universe.

          On Earth, hydrogen is believed to have been present since its
          formation about 4.5 billion years ago. It was likely a major component
          of the early atmosphere and oceans, but due to its high reactivity, it
          gradually reacted with other elements to form compounds such as water
          and methane. As a result, free hydrogen became scarce on Earth's
          surface, although it remained abundant in the atmosphere of the outer
          planets like Jupiter and Saturn.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              The scientific study of hydrogen began in the 16th century when
              the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus observed the reaction between iron
              and sulfuric acid, which produced a gas that he called "gas
              venenatum" (poisonous gas). In the 17th century, the English
              scientist Henry Cavendish further investigated this gas and
              recognized it as a distinct substance. He named it "inflammable
              air" due to its ability to burn.

              In the 18th century, the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier
              conducted a series of experiments that helped establish the true
              nature of hydrogen. He showed that water is composed of hydrogen
              and oxygen, and he gave hydrogen its current name, derived from
              the Greek words "hydro" (water) and "genes" (forming).

          production of fertilizers, plastics, and other chemicals.
          Additionally, hydrogen is being explored as a potential clean energy
