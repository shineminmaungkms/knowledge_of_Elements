          Beryllium is a solid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It
          is part of the metal family and consistent with the high
          charge-to-radius ratio, beryllium has a strong tendency to form
          compounds via covalent bonds, even compounds with the most
          electronegative elements (e.g., BeF2).

          Beryllium is a chemical element with atomic number 41. This means
          there are 4 protons and 4 electrons in the atomic structure. The atom

          rapidly moving electrons.

          Beryllium was first discovered as an oxide in the minerals beryl and
          emerald by the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin in 1798. He
          named it beryllium after the Greek word for beryl, beryllos. The metal
          was isolated in 1828 by two chemists, Friedrich WÃ¶hler from Germany
          and Antoine Bussy from France, who independently reduced beryllium
          chloride with potassium

              Beryllium is found in about 30 different minerals, but the most
              important ones are beryl and bertrandite. The United States,
              China, Mozambique, and Brazil are the major producers of beryllium
              in the world. Beryllium has some unique properties, such as high
              melting point, low density, high stiffness, and resistance to
              corrosion. It also has a high affinity for oxygen and forms a thin
              oxide layer on its surface that protects it from further
              oxidation. Beryllium is also non-magnetic and has a high thermal
              conductivity.

          Beryllium is a toxic element that can cause serious health problems if
          inhaled or ingested. Exposure to beryllium dust or fumes can cause a
          lung disease called chronic beryllium disease, which can lead to
          scarring, inflammation, and fibrosis of the lung tissue. Beryllium can
          also cause skin rashes, ulcers, and allergic reactions. Beryllium is
          classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for
          Research on Cancer.

          The primary sources of beryllium are the minerals beryl and
          bertrandite. Beryl is a beryllium aluminum silicate mineral that is
          found in pegmatites, which are igneous rocks that form when magma
          cools slowly deep underground. Bertrandite is a beryllium silicate
          mineral that is found in hydrothermal veins, which are formed when hot
          water dissolves minerals and deposits them in cracks and fissures in
          the Earth's crust.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          Beryllium can also be found in other minerals, such as chrysoberyl,
          phenakite, and euclase. However, these minerals are less common and
          are not as economically viable sources of beryllium as beryl and
          bertrandite.

          Beryllium is a valuable metal due to its unique properties, such as
          its high strength, low density, and excellent thermal conductivity. It
          is used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive,
          and electronics. Beryllium is also used in the production of nuclear
          weapons and in the manufacture of certain medical devices.

          Beryllium is a light metal with a gray-white color and a hexagonal
          crystal structure. It has an atomic number of 4 and an atomic mass of
          9.0121831 u. It has two electrons in its outermost shell, which gives
          it a valence of 2. Beryllium is one of the hardest and most brittle
          metals, and it has a very high melting point of 1560 K and a boiling
          point of 2742 K.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          Beryllium is also a good conductor of electricity and heat, with an
          electrical conductivity of 36 MS/m and a thermal conductivity of 200
          W/(m K). It has a low density of 1.85 g/cm^3 and a low specific heat
          capacity of 1.825 J/(g K). Beryllium has a high ionization energy of
          899.5 kJ/mol, which means it is difficult to remove an electron from
          its atom. Its electron configuration is [He] 2s^2 2p^2, which shows
          that it has four electrons in total.

        <p class="text text-white p-2">
          Beryllium has many applications in various industries, such as
          aerospace, nuclear, medical, and electronic. It is used as an alloying
          agent in copper, aluminum, magnesium, and nickel alloys, to improve
          their strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability.
          Beryllium is also used in nuclear reactors as a moderator and
          reflector, because it slows down and reflects neutrons. Beryllium is
          also used in medical devices, such as X-ray tubes and MRI scanners,
          because it is transparent to X-rays and has a low magnetic
          susceptibility. Beryllium is also used in electronic components, such
          as transistors, switches, and relays, because it has a high electrical
          resistance and a low contact resistance. However, beryllium is also
          highly toxic and can cause serious lung diseases if inhaled as dust or
          fumes. Beryllium can also cause skin rashes, eye irritation, and
          allergic reactions. Therefore, beryllium must be handled with care and
          proper protection. Beryllium is classified as a carcinogen by the
          International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US
          Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
