            Neon, with the symbol Ne and atomic number 10, is the second noble
            gas on the periodic table. It's colorless, odorless, and inert under
            normal conditions, meaning it doesn't readily react with other
            elements. Interestingly, while lighter than air, it's still about
            two-thirds as dense. Extracting neon involves cryogenic air
            separation, where it's separated from a mixture of gases like
            nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen.

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Fluorine boasts the title of the most electronegative element,
            Neon's most recognizable claim to fame lies in its ability to
            produce vibrant, glowing signs. When electricity passes through neon
            gas in a sealed glass tube, it excites the gas atoms, causing them
            to emit light. Different colors can be achieved by adding other
            gases to the neon, creating the eye-catching displays we often
            associate with nightlife and advertising.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Neon has various applications beyond lighting. It's used in
            cryogenic refrigeration due to its low boiling point. Additionally,
            its inert nature makes it useful in high-voltage electrical
            components like transformers and lasers. Even scuba divers breathe a
            mixture containing small amounts of neon to prevent decompression
            sickness.

          Neon wears two hats: a colorless, odorless, inert noble gas (symbol
          Ne, atomic number 10) and a vibrant illuminator. Found in air through
          complex separation processes, it ignites into glowing signs when
          electrified, painting the night with its characteristic colors. This
          versatile element finds uses beyond aesthetics, from chilling things

          In 1898, British chemists Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers
          stumbled upon a brilliant discovery while liquefying air. As they
          separated various gases, they encountered a new element glowing a
          vibrant red: neon, aptly named from the Greek word "neos" meaning
          "new." This discovery opened the door to exciting possibilities.

              While the initial neon lamps emitted only red light, French
              engineer Georges Claude saw their potential. In 1910, he unveiled
              the first neon lamp, but it wasn't until 1923 that he discovered
              the key to creating colorful signs. By bending neon tubes and
              filling them with different gas combinations, Claude birthed the
              iconic neon signs that would illuminate cities and captivate
              audiences worldwide.

          <ul class="text-white">
            <li>
              Unlike traditional bulbs that need frequent replacements, neon
              signs boast an impressive lifespan, typically lasting 10-15 years
              with proper care. This translates to long-term cost savings and
              reduced maintenance hassle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compared to many other lighting options, neon signs are
              surprisingly energy-efficient. They consume roughly the same
              amount of energy as a standard light bulb, making them an
              eco-friendly choice.
            </li>

            <li>
              Neon's ability to emit vibrant and customizable colors creates
              visually stunning displays that grab attention and leave a lasting
              impression. This makes them ideal for businesses seeking to
              enhance their brand visibility and attract customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unlike rigid light fixtures, neon allows for flexible shaping and
              intricate designs. Skilled artisans can bend the glass tubes into
              various forms, creating unique and personalized signs that cater
              to specific aesthetic preferences.

          While neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe, it's
          surprisingly scarce on Earth. Our primary source for this vibrant gas
          comes from fractional distillation of liquefied air. This process
          separates various gases present in air, including nitrogen, helium,
          and neon. Despite its low concentration, this method efficiently
          extracts enough neon to meet our diverse needs, from illuminating
          signs to keeping things cool in cryogenics.
