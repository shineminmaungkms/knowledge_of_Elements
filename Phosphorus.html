            Phosphorus is a chemical element; it has symbol P and atomic number
            15. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus
            and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is
            never found as a free element on Earth. It has a concentration in
            the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at
            about 0.06 grams). In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as
            phosphate.

            Function. The main function of phosphorus is in the formation of
            bones and teeth. It plays an important role in how the body uses
            carbohydrates and fats. It is also needed for the body to make
            protein for the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and
            tissues.

          Phosphorus has 15 protons and 16 neutrons in its nucleus giving it an

          of the Periodic Table because it has 3 electron shells.

          Phosphorus was first made by Hennig Brandt at Hamburg in 1669 when he
          evaporated urine and heated the residue until it was red hot,
          whereupon phosphorus vapour distilled which he collected by condensing
          it in water. Brandt kept his discovery secret, thinking he had
          discovered the Philosopherâ€™s Stone that could turn base metals into
          gold. When he ran out of money, he sold phosphorus to Daniel Kraft who
          exhibited it around Europe including London where Robert Boyle was
          fascinated by it. He discovered how it was produced and investigated
          it systematically. (His assistant Ambrose Godfrey set up his own
          business making and selling phosphorus and became rich.)

              When it was realised that bone was calcium phosphate, and could be
              used to make phosphorus, and it became more widely available.
              Demand from match manufacturers in the 1800s ensured a ready
              market.

          The main function of phosphorus is in the formation of bones and
          teeth. Phosphorus can also be found in a variety of products such as
          baking powder, fertilisers, and fireworks. It also plays an important
          role in the production of steel. Phosphates are also used in the
          production of fine chinaware and special glasses.

          sources are dairy, red meat, poultry, seafood, legumes, and nuts.
          Phosphorus from these foods is called organic phosphorus. It is
          absorbed more efficiently from animal foods than plant foods.

          appearing yellowish or colourless, and some have described its odour
          as resembling garlic. It ignites instantly upon contact with oxygen.
          It is often used by militaries to illuminate battlefields, to generate
          a smokescreen and as an incendiary.
