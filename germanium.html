            Germanium, a grayish-white metalloid, shares similarities with
            silicon and tin. Although initially used in early transistors, its
            reign was surpassed by the cheaper and more efficient silicon.
            However, germanium still finds crucial applications in fiber-optic
            systems, infrared optics, solar cells, and LEDs.

          Germanium, with the symbol Ge and atomic number 32, is a fascinating
          element that straddles the line between metal and non-metal. This
          grayish-white metalloid shares properties with its neighbors silicon
          and tin, exhibiting both metallic and non-metallic characteristics.
          Despite being overshadowed by silicon in some early electronic
          applications, germanium remains crucial in fiber optics, infrared

          In 1871, the visionary chemist Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the
          existence of an element missing from his newly organized periodic
          table. He named it "ekasilicon," based on its expected position
          between silicon and tin.

              confirmed Mendeleev's prediction by isolating the element from a
              silver ore. He named it "germanium" after his home country.
              Initially, germanium's applications were limited, but it found its
              first major use in point-contact diodes during World War II.
