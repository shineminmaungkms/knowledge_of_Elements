            Actinium, element 89, resides in the shadows of the periodic table.
            This soft, silvery metal is incredibly rare, found only in trace
            amounts within uranium ores. All its known isotopes are radioactive,
            making it 150 times more potent than radium! Due to this intense
            radioactivity, actinium exhibits a faint blue glow in the dark, a
            mesmerizing yet dangerous spectacle.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While fiercely independent in its radioactive domain, actinium
            resembles lanthanum, the first lanthanide, in terms of its chemical
            behavior. This makes separating them a challenging task, adding to
            its scarcity and mystique. Despite its challenges, understanding its
            properties holds potential for future applications.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            With limited current uses outside research, actinium's future
            remains veiled. However, its unique radioactive properties offer
            intriguing possibilities. Ongoing research explores its potential in
            targeted alpha therapy for cancer treatment, harnessing its
            destructive power with laser-like precision. While actinium remains
            a complex and guarded element, its potential to illuminate new
            solutions in medicine and beyond keeps researchers captivated.

          potent alpha radiation, it's 150 times more intense than radium!
          Chemically akin to lanthanum, this elusive element hides within
          uranium ores, posing a challenge to isolate. Though limited in current
          applications, research delves into its potential for targeted cancer

        <p class="text text-white">
          Actinium, element 89, packs a radioactive punch within its 89 protons
          and 138 neutrons (in its most stable form). Its seven electron shells
          hold the key to its behavior: two "valence electrons" in the outermost
          shell readily detach, turning Actinium into a positively charged metal
          ion. This, combined with its large size and unique electron
          arrangement, gives it a chemical personality quite different from its
          neighbors. While fascinating, this structure also makes Actinium
          highly radioactive, emitting alpha particles and glowing with an eerie
          blue light.

          In 1899, French chemist André-Louis Debierne glimpsed a faint glow
          while studying pitchblende residues. This elusive luminescence,
          initially confused with another element, was actually actinium, named
          after the Greek word for "ray" due to its radioactivity. However,
          credit wasn't so simple. Just three years later, German chemist
          Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered the same element,
          unaware of Debierne's work, and named it "emanium." The debate over
          who truly found it lasted for years.

              The "Radium Girls," young women painting watch dials with luminous
              radium paint, bore the brunt of its hidden dangers. Tragically
              exposed to radiation without knowledge or protection, they

          While elusive, actinium isn't entirely hidden. This radioactive
          treasure trove exists in trace amounts within uranium ores, found most
          commonly in rocks and soil. Extracting it is no easy feat, requiring

          radioactivity. All known isotopes emit potent alpha, beta, and gamma
          rays, causing the element to faintly glow blue in the dark. However,
          this luminescence comes with a hefty safety concern.

          compounds and loses three electrons to become a positively charged ion
          (Ac³⁺). This chemical similarity makes separating and studying it
          quite challenging.
