            Argon is a chemical element in the eighteen group of the periodic
            table. It is a noble gas, and it is the third most abundant gas in
            earth's atmosphere. Argon is the most common gas in the atmosphere
            besides Nitrogen and Oxygen. Argon is a noble gas (like helium)
            which means that it is completely inert.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Argon is often used when an inert atmosphere is needed. It is used
            in this way for the production of titanium and other reactive
            elements. It is also used by welders to protect the weld area and in
            incandescent light bulbs to stop oxygen from corroding the filament.

          Argon has the atomic number 18 and is a noble gas found in group 18 in
          the Periodic Table. It is the third noble gas and sits below neon and
          above krypton. Argon is a colorless and odorless gas and does not
          react with other substances under normal conditions.

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          The nucleus consists of 18 protons (red) and 22 neutrons (orange). 18
          electrons (white) occupy shells (rings); eight fill the outer (third)
          electron shell in what is a very stable configuration. The stability
          of an element's outer (valence) electrons determines its chemical and
          physical properties.

          Although argon is abundant in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, it evaded
          discovery until 1894 when Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay first
          separated it from liquid air. In fact the gas had been isolated in
          1785 by Henry Cavendish who had noted that about 1% of air would not
          react even under the most extreme conditions. That 1% was argon.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              Argon was discovered as a result of trying to explain why the
              density of nitrogen extracted from air differed from that obtained
              by the decomposition of ammonia.
              <br /><br />
              Ramsay removed all the nitrogen from the gas he had extracted from
              air, and did this by reacting it with hot magnesium, forming the
              solid magnesium nitride. He was then left with a gas that would
              not react and when he examined its spectrum he saw new groups of
              red and green lines, confirming that it was a new element.

          Argon provides an inert atmosphere in which welded metals will not
          oxidise. Argon is a colourless, odourless gas that is totally inert to
          other substances. Argon is often used when an inert atmosphere is
          needed. It is used in this way for the production of titanium and
          other reactive elements.

            <li>
              <b>Inert atmosphere:</b>Argon is often used to create an inert
              atmosphere, which means it does not react with other substances.
              This is useful in welding, where it protects the molten metal from
              oxidation, and in food processing, where it helps to preserve food
              by preventing spoilage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lighting:</b>Argon is used in incandescent light bulbs and
              fluorescent tubes to prevent the filament or electrodes from
              burning out too quickly. It also helps to create a more even light
              distribution.

            <li>
              <b>Electronics:</b> Argon is used in the production of some
              electronic components, such as computer chips and solar panels. It
              helps to create a clean and controlled environment for
              manufacturing these delicate devices.

          <ul class="text-white">
            <li>
              Argon is used to create an inert atmosphere around the weld area,
              protecting the molten metal from oxidation and improving weld
              quality. This is important for various applications, including
              construction, shipbuilding, and automotive manufacturing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Argon is used to preserve food by preventing spoilage. It does
              this by displacing oxygen, which can cause food to oxidize and
              degrade. This is used in packaging and storing food items such as
              fruits, vegetables, and meat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Argon is used to fill incandescent light bulbs, preventing the
              filament from burning out too quickly. This helps the bulbs last
              longer and reduces the need for frequent replacements.

          Argon makes up 0.94% of the Earth's atmosphere and is the third most
          abundant atmospheric gas. Levels have gradually increased since the
          Earth was formed because radioactive potassium-40 turns into argon as
          it decays. Argon is obtained commercially by the distillation of
          liquid air.

          excited-state complexes, such as ArF, have been demonstrated.
