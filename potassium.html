            Potassium is a chemical element; it has symbol K (from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. It is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Potassium is found naturally in many foods and as a supplement. Its main role in the body is to help maintain normal levels of fluid inside our cells. Sodium, its counterpart, maintains normal fluid levels outside of cells. Potassium also helps muscles to contract and supports normal blood pressure.

          Potassium is a chemical element with many roles and identities. On the periodic table, it's element number 19, symbolized by K. In nature, it's rarely found alone, but rather as part of compounds like potassium chloride, a key ingredient in table salt.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white text-center m-3">
          But perhaps potassium's most interesting identity is as a vital nutrient for living things. It helps muscles contract, nerves transmit signals, and even regulates heartbeat. From the tiniest organisms to the human body, potassium is an essential part of life's processes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          Potassium, with the symbol K, is the 19th element on the periodic table. Each potassium atom has a positively charged core, called the nucleus, made up of 19 protons and typically 20 neutrons. Surrounding the nucleus are 19 negatively charged electrons, arranged in layers called energy levels. The outermost energy level, with just one electron, is key to understanding potassium's unique properties and how it interacts with other elements.

            Potassium has a rich history dating back centuries, though its pure metallic form is a relatively recent discovery. For millennia, people have utilized various naturally occurring potassium compounds without knowing the element itself existed.

                Potassium-rich compounds like potash (potassium carbonate) were extracted from wood ash and used in soap making, glass production, and even medicine. The compound saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was crucial for the development of gunpowder, playing a significant role in warfare and exploration.
                <br><br>
                It wasn't until 1807 that English chemist Humphry Davy successfully isolated pure potassium metal using a revolutionary technique called electrolysis. This marked a turning point in our understanding of elements and paved the way for further discoveries in the field of chemistry.

            For humans, potassium is a vital mineral. It supports healthy muscles and nerves, regulates blood pressure, and aids in heart function. We get potassium from a variety of delicious foods, including fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and dairy products. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in these potassium sources is key to optimal health and well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-white text-center m-3">
          In the plant world, potassium is a major component of fertilizer. It helps plants build strong cell walls, resist disease, and produce abundant fruits and vegetables. Farmers carefully manage potassium levels in their soil to ensure healthy, thriving crops that nourish us all.
