            Gadolinium (Gd), a silvery-white metal belonging to the rare-earth
            elements, might not be a household name, but it plays important
            roles in various technologies. Found primarily in minerals like
            monazite and bastnaesite, it possesses unique properties that make
            it valuable.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            One key feature of gadolinium is its magnetism. Below a certain
            temperature, it turns ferromagnetic, attracted to magnets even
            stronger than nickel. This property makes it useful in alloys for
            magnets used in electronics and data storage. Additionally,
            gadolinium absorbs neutrons efficiently, finding applications in
            nuclear reactors.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Gadolinium also shines in the medical field. Its compounds are used
            as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), enhancing
            image clarity and aiding diagnosis of tumors and other
            abnormalities. However, safety concerns regarding potential
            gadolinium retention in the body are under investigation.

          Gadolinium (Gd), with its atomic number 64 and silvery gleam, is a
          member of the rare-earth family. Although not abundant, it carries
          unique properties hidden beneath its unassuming facade. This soft,
          malleable metal boasts a powerful magnetic personality, switching from
          paramagnetic to ferromagnetic – stronger than nickel – at cool
          temperatures. It shines in medical settings as a contrast agent in
          MRIs, revealing secrets within our bodies. Beyond its medical feats,
          gadolinium strengthens alloys, enhances fuel cells, and even dabbles

          The story of gadolinium begins in 1792 with Finnish chemist Johan
          Gadolin, who isolated the first rare-earth compound from a black
          mineral later named gadolinite. But the true identity of gadolinium
          remained hidden for almost a century. Fast forward to 1880, when Swiss
          chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac noticed curious spectral
          lines in samples of gadolinite and another mineral. These lines
          differed from known elements, hinting at something new. The race was
          on! French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran finally isolated
          the pure element in 1886, recognizing its connection to gadolinite and
          christening it "gadolinium."

              The early 20th century saw scientists unraveling gadolinium's
              unique properties. Its strong magnetism caught attention, leading
              to its use in alloys for stronger magnets. Meanwhile, the
              discovery of its neutron-absorbing ability paved the way for
              applications in nuclear technology. In the 1980s, gadolinium
              compounds revolutionized medical imaging with the advent of MRI
