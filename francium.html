            Francium, element number 87, holds a unique position in the periodic
            table. While other elements proudly display their properties in
            abundance, francium exists only in fleeting moments. Its most stable
            isotope, francium-223, boasts a meager half-life of just 22 minutes,
            making it the second-rarest naturally occurring element (astatine
            takes the crown).
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its scarcity, francium's chemistry shines brightly. As the
            heaviest member of the alkali metal family, it shares their highly
            reactive nature. With the easiest atom to lose an electron, francium
            ranks just behind caesium as the most electropositive element. This
            fiery personality makes it highly volatile, reacting aggressively
            with water and even glass.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            However, studying francium directly is no easy feat. Due to its
            radioactivity and scarcity, only microscopic amounts can be
            isolated. Scientists primarily work with francium in solution or as
            an amalgam with mercury, gleaning its secrets through clever
            experiments and advanced spectroscopic techniques. While its
            practical applications are limited, francium continues to intrigue
            researchers, offering valuable insights into the behavior of heavy
            elements and the ever-evolving landscape of the periodic table.

          Francium, the element with the atomic number 87, is a fleeting phantom
          on the periodic table. This rarest of metals exists only in the decay
          chain of heavier elements, boasting a half-life of a mere 22 minutes.
          Despite its scarcity, it proudly claims the title of the most
          electropositive element, showcasing its highly reactive nature in the
          alkali metal family. Studying this fiery personality directly is a
          challenge due to its radioactivity and limited presence, but
          scientists persevere, unraveling its secrets through advanced
          techniques. While its practical applications remain elusive,
          francium's identity as a unique and fascinating element burns brightly
          in the scientific quest for knowledge.

          87. The hunt for this missing piece spanned generations. Claims and

              Finally, in 1939, Marguerite Perey at the Curie Institute in Paris
              found the key. While purifying actinium, she observed persistent
              radioactivity even after removing all known impurities. This
              anomaly pointed to an unseen element, and Perey, with meticulous
              work and unwavering intuition, isolated and identified it. She

              However, the victory was bittersweet. Francium's fleeting nature
              became apparent - its most stable isotope decayed within 22
              minutes. This extreme rarity hampered further exploration, pushing
              researchers to employ ingenious techniques like studying francium
              in solution or as an amalgam with mercury. While francium may

          While francium doesn't exist naturally in large quantities, its
          fleeting presence can be found in two places: decay chains and
          particle bombardment. Trace amounts, about 30 grams on Earth at any
          given time, appear as a byproduct of the alpha decay of actinium in
          uranium ores. This "natural" source, however, offers only
          infinitesimal amounts. For larger quantities, scientists create
          francium in labs through two methods: bombarding radium with neutrons
          in nuclear reactors or bombarding thorium with protons. Regardless of
          the source, francium's scarcity and short half-life make it a precious
          and challenging element to study, demanding cutting-edge techniques
