          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found in rocks, soil, and
            water. It exists in two main forms: organic and inorganic. Organic
            arsenic, commonly present in seafood, is less harmful than inorganic
            arsenic, which is often found in contaminated drinking water and
            industrial sites.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Exposure to arsenic, particularly the inorganic form, can be
            detrimental to health. Acute poisoning symptoms include vomiting,
            diarrhea, and numbness. Long-term exposure is linked to various
            health issues, including skin cancer, bladder cancer, and even
            diabetes.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its toxicity, arsenic has various industrial applications in
            wood preservation, pesticides, and electronics. However, due to its
            harmful effects, it's crucial to handle arsenic with extreme caution
            and adhere to safety regulations to minimize exposure risks.

          Arsenic, element number 33 on the periodic table, possesses a complex
          identity. Classified as a metalloid, it exhibits characteristics of
          both metals and non-metals. It can exist in several forms, with the
          most common being a steel-gray, brittle solid. While sometimes
          referred to as a metal, it shares properties like forming covalent
          bonds with other elements, which is typical of non-metals.
          Additionally, arsenic exists in various oxidation states, influencing
          its behavior and potential toxicity.

          Traces of arsenic use date back centuries. As early as the Bronze Age,
          civilizations incorporated it into bronze for increased strength.
          Ancient Egyptians and Greeks recognized its toxicity, with some
          accounts suggesting its use as a weapon. The Chinese also documented
          its properties, utilizing it as a pesticide in rice cultivation.

              The Middle Ages saw a shift in arsenic's perception. It gained
              notoriety as a potent poison, earning the nickname "inheritance
              powder" due to its frequent use in eliminating unwanted family
              members. Ironically, the 18th and 19th centuries witnessed its
              emergence as a "miracle cure" for various ailments, including
              syphilis. However, its effectiveness came at a heavy cost, often
              leading to unintended poisoning and highlighting its treacherous
              nature.

              The 20th century witnessed extensive industrial use of arsenic in
              wood preservation and pesticides. However, growing awareness of
              its environmental and health hazards led to stricter regulations
              and eventual bans on many applications. Today, arsenic remains a

          Despite its toxicity, arsenic has found various applications
          throughout history. Historically, it was used in bronze for weapons
          and tools, and as a pigment in paints and dyes. In the past, it also
          held a dubious reputation as a pesticide and even a medicinal
          treatment. Today, its use is more controlled, primarily found in
          semiconductor materials, wood preservatives (though increasingly
