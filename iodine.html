          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Iodine is a trace mineral vital for the human body, primarily
            playing a critical role in the production of thyroid hormones. These
            hormones regulate metabolism, growth, development, and various other
            bodily functions. Insufficient iodine intake can lead to serious
            health complications, including goiter, hypothyroidism, and even
            intellectual disabilities, particularly in children.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While the human body cannot produce iodine, it can be obtained
            through various dietary sources. Seafood, especially seaweed and
            cod, are particularly rich in iodine. Additionally, dairy products,
            eggs, and iodized salt are significant contributors. Iodization of
            table salt has been instrumental in significantly reducing iodine
            deficiency disorders worldwide.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Beyond its biological importance, iodine finds applications in
            various industrial and scientific fields. It acts as a disinfectant
            and antiseptic, used in wound healing solutions and topical
            medications. In its radioactive form, iodine has medical
            applications in thyroid imaging and treatment of certain thyroid
            cancers. Additionally, iodine compounds are used in photography,
            dyes, and some industrial processes.

          Iodine wears two hats: a vital nutrient and a versatile chemical
          element. As a nutrient, it's crucial for producing thyroid hormones,
          impacting metabolism, growth, and development. Its deficiency can lead
          to health issues. Chemically, iodine is a halogen, existing as a dark
          violet solid at room temperature. It's found naturally in some foods
          and seawater, but its widespread availability came with the iodization
          of salt, significantly reducing iodine deficiency disorders. This
          unique element plays a vital role in both biological and industrial
          applications.

          The story of iodine begins in 1811 with Bernard Courtois, a French
          chemist. While extracting saltpeter from seaweed ash, he observed an
          unusual purple vapor. This curiosity led him to isolate a dark
          substance, unknowingly becoming the first to encounter iodine.
          Recognizing its novelty, he named it after the Greek word for
          "violet-colored."

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              The following years saw scientists unraveling iodine's properties.
              In 1813, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac confirmed its elemental nature,
              solidifying its place on the periodic table. Soon after,
              Jean-Fran√ßois Coindet observed its effectiveness in treating
              goiter, a condition linked to iodine deficiency. However, the
              crucial connection between iodine and the thyroid gland remained
              unknown until 1896, when Eugen Baumann discovered its presence
              within this vital organ.

              a similar element. Recognizing its novelty, he named it
              "tellurium" after the Latin word for Earth, as it was the only
              planet at the time not associated with an element. Interestingly,
              Klaproth also named another element, uranium, after this newly
              discovered tellurium.

            <li>
              Iodine's primary benefit lies in its crucial role for the thyroid
              gland. It's essential for producing thyroid hormones, which
              regulate metabolism, growth, development, and numerous bodily
              functions. Adequate iodine intake helps maintain proper thyroid
              function, preventing complications like goiter and hypothyroidism.

              During pregnancy and early childhood, iodine is vital for the
              proper development of the brain and nervous system. Sufficient
              iodine intake in pregnant women ensures healthy cognitive function
              and intellectual development in their children, reducing the risk
              of intellectual disabilities.
            </li>

            <li>
              Iodine plays a role in regulating menstrual cycles and ovulation,
              impacting fertility in women. Adequate iodine levels can
              contribute to a healthy reproductive system and may even reduce
              the risk of miscarriage.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the thyroid gland doesn't function properly due to iodine
              deficiency, it can lead to fatigue and sluggishness. Maintaining
