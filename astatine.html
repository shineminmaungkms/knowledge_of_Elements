            Astatine, with the symbol At and atomic number 85, holds the dubious
            title of the rarest naturally occurring element on Earth. It only
            exists as a fleeting byproduct of the decay of heavier elements, and
            all its isotopes are radioactive with short lifespans. The most
            stable isotope, astatine-210, boasts a measly half-life of just 8.1
            hours, meaning half of its atoms will decay in that timeframe. This
            extreme instability makes it impossible to accumulate enough
            astatine to form a visible, solid sample.

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While astatine currently has no practical applications, its
            potential lies in the realm of medical research. The specific
            properties of certain astatine isotopes make them promising
            candidates for targeted alpha therapy, a potential treatment for

            the periodic table, it belongs to the halogen group, sharing
            chemical similarities with elements like chlorine and iodine.
            However, due to its radioactivity, studying its bulk properties in
            detail remains a challenge.

          The story of astatine begins long before its actual discovery. In
          1869, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, predicted
          the existence of an element occupying the space below iodine. This
          hypothetical element, dubbed "eka-iodine," sparked the curiosity of
          scientists for decades.

              The first attempts to find astatine in nature proved fruitless. In
              1939, two separate groups reported possible detections, but their
              findings couldn't be conclusively verified. Finally, in 1940, the
              elusive element was successfully synthesized at the University of
              California, Berkeley. Dale Corson, Kenneth MacKenzie, and Emilio
              Segr√® bombarded bismuth with alpha particles, creating
              astatine-211, the first confirmed isotope. The name "astatine"
              comes from the Greek word "astatos," meaning "unstable,"
              reflecting the element's inherent radioactivity.
