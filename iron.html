          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Iron is the fourth most abundant element, by mass, in the Earth's crust. The core of the Earth is thought to be largely composed of iron with nickel and sulfur. The most common iron-containing ore is haematite, but iron is found widely distributed in other minerals such as magnetite and taconite.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Iron is used to make alloy steels like carbon steels with additives such as nickel, chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and manganese. These are used to make bridges, electricity pylons, bicycle chains, cutting tools and rifle barrels. Cast iron contains 3–5% carbon. It is used for pipes, valves, and pumps

          Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe and atomic number 26. Classified as a transition metal, Iron is a solid at room temperature.

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          A neutral iron atom contains 26 protons and 30 neutrons plus 26 electrons in four different shells around the nucleus. As with other transition metals, a variable number of electrons from iron's two outermost shells are available to combine with other elements.

            Iron's story stretches back billions of years, starting in the fiery hearts of stars. Exploding stars forged iron, which scattered through space and eventually formed part of our planet. Meteors, remnants of those stellar explosions, brought iron to Earth, where it lay hidden for millennia.

          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
                The earliest evidence of humans using iron dates back to around 4,000 BC. By heating iron-rich rocks in simple furnaces, people discovered they could extract the metal. This marked a turning point in human history, ushering in the Iron Age. Iron's strength and versatility revolutionized tools, weapons, and construction, shaping societies and cultures for centuries to come.

            Iron is one of the most common elements on Earth and can be found in a variety of places. Here are some examples:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-white">
            <li>
              Iron is a major component of many rocks and minerals, including hematite, magnetite, and limonite. These are the primary sources of iron used in industrial processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iron is an essential nutrient for humans and can be found in many foods, such as meat, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, fortified cereals, dark leafy green vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iron is naturally present in soil and can be absorbed by plants, making it part of the food chain.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

          <ul class="text-white">
            <li>
              Pure iron has a shiny silver-gray luster and is one of the few elements naturally magnetic. This property has been harnessed for centuries in compasses, motors, and other applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              While iron on its own is brittle, when combined with carbon in the right proportions, it forms steel, an incredibly strong and versatile material used in construction, tools, and countless other applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iron readily reacts with oxygen and water, forming iron oxide, commonly known as rust. This process can be a challenge in some situations but also has artistic applications, like creating patinas on sculptures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iron plays a crucial role in biological processes, particularly within red blood cells where it helps transport oxygen throughout the body.
            </li>
            <p class="text-white">Iron's diverse properties make it a valuable element across many fields, from engineering and construction to biology and art.</p>
