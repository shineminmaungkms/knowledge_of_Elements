          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Berkelium isn't found in nature. This silvery-white radioactive
            metal was born in the heart of a cyclotron at the University of
            California, Berkeley, in 1949. It earned its name from its
            birthplace, becoming the fifth transuranium element discovered
            (those heavier than uranium).
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            All berkelium isotopes are radioactive, though some last longer than
            others. The most stable, berkelium-247, boasts a half-life of 1,380
            years. Despite its instability, berkelium exhibits fascinating
            properties. It's soft, malleable, and highly reactive, readily
            forming bonds with other elements.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Currently, berkelium has no commercial applications due to its
            rarity and radioactivity. However, its role in scientific research
            is significant. It has been used to create even heavier elements and
            shed light on the intriguing world of the actinides. While its
            practical use might lie far in the future, berkelium's contribution
            to our understanding of the universe is undeniable.

          Berkelium, with the symbol Bk and atomic number 97, isn't a natural
          wonder. Crafted in 1949 within a Berkeley cyclotron, this man-made
          marvel belongs to the actinide and transuranium families. Imagine a
          silvery-white metal, radioactive and quite rare, that readily bonds
          with others. Although lacking commercial use due to its scarcity and
          radioactivity, berkelium's true identity lies in its contribution to
          scientific frontiers. It plays a key role in creating even heavier
          elements and unraveling the mysteries of the actinide world, making it
          a valuable tool for pushing the boundaries of our understanding.

          americium-241 with alpha particles, this transuranium element, heavier
          than any found naturally, marked a significant step in human
          exploration of the periodic table.
