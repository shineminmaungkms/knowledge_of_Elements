            Neptunium, with the symbol Np and atomic number 93, holds a unique
            place in the periodic table. It's the first transuranic element,
            meaning it doesn't naturally occur on Earth in significant amounts.
            Instead, it's created through nuclear reactions, either artificially
            in labs or as a byproduct in nuclear reactors. Its name reflects its
            position following uranium, just as Neptune follows Uranus in our
            solar system.

            However, due to its radioactivity and potential for misuse,

          Neptunium, element number 93, stands out as a man-made marvel. Found
          nowhere on Earth in its natural state, it was first conjured in a lab
          by bombarding uranium with neutrons. This transuranic element, named
          after the planet beyond Uranus, possesses a silvery sheen and hides a
          potent secret: radioactivity. Neptunium's atoms are inherently
          unstable, constantly shedding energy and transforming into other
          elements over time. While fascinating for scientists, this instability
          renders it hazardous, demanding careful handling and reminding us of
          the power and complexities hidden within the atomic world.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          A neptunium atom has 93 electrons, arranged in the configuration [Rn]
          5f4 6d1 7s2. This differs from the configuration expected by the
          Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of
          being as expected in the 5f subshell. Further exploration revealed
          neptunium's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. As uranium-238 absorbs
          neutrons in reactors, it converts into plutonium-239, a fuel source.
          But before becoming plutonium, uranium goes through an intermediate
          stage: neptunium-239. This realization solidified neptunium's place in
          the nuclear realm, albeit a short-lived one as it quickly decays into
          plutonium.

          Neptunium's story unfolds in the heart of scientific discovery. In
          1940, at the University of California, Berkeley, Edwin McMillan and
          Philip Abelson conjured the element into existence. Bombarding uranium
          with neutrons, they witnessed the birth of neptunium, the first
          transuranic element ever created. Its name pays homage to its position
          on the periodic table, following uranium just as Neptune follows
          Uranus in the solar system.

              However, traces were later discovered in uranium ores, remnants of

              findings painted a fascinating picture of neptunium's prehistoric

          While it might seem like something from outer space, Neptunium
          actually has two sources: human ingenuity and Earth's hidden history.
          Primarily, it's crafted in nuclear reactors as a byproduct of
          uranium-238 absorbing neutrons. This nuclear alchemy births
          Neptunium-239, which quickly decays into the most common isotope,
