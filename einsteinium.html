            This elusive element, named after the legendary physicist Albert
            Einstein, is entirely man-made. Born from the debris of the first
            hydrogen bomb test in 1952, it exists in fleeting quantities, with

            nestled between californium and fermium on the periodic table.
            Sharing similarities with its lanthanide neighbor, holmium,
            einsteinium is highly reactive and predominantly exists in a +3
            oxidation state.

          after the genius physicist, it shines with radioactivity, a silvery
          ghost residing in the actinide family. Forget finding it in nature;
          this fleeting element exists in mere milligrams, produced in nuclear

          The story of einsteinium begins not in a lab, but with a bang. In
          1952, the first hydrogen bomb was detonated on Enewetak Atoll,
          unleashing unimaginable power. When the dust settled, scientists
          ventured into the radioactive aftermath, collecting debris for
          analysis. In a lab at Berkeley, California, a team led by Albert
          Ghiorso made a surprising discovery: amidst the irradiated particles,
          nestled a new element, number 99.

              physicist's groundbreaking work on relativity and nuclear energy.
              However, identifying einsteinium was no easy feat. Only 200 atoms
              were initially found, requiring meticulous chemical separation and
              radioactive detection techniques. The discovery remained
              classified until 1955 due to the sensitive nature of nuclear
              research during the Cold War.
