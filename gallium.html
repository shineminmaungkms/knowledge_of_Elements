            Gallium, with the symbol Ga and atomic number 31, is a fascinating
            element known for its unusual properties. Discovered in 1875, it
            belongs to group 13 of the periodic table, sharing similarities with
            aluminum, indium, and thallium. Unlike most metals, gallium boasts a
            remarkably low melting point of 29.76 °C (85.57 °F). This means it
            melts in your hand at body temperature, transforming from a soft
            solid to a silvery liquid.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its low melting point, gallium finds numerous applications.
            Its most significant use lies in the realm of electronics. Gallium
            arsenide, a compound formed with gallium, is crucial for producing
            microwave circuits, high-speed switches, and infrared devices.
            Additionally, gallium-based alloys with low melting points serve as
            substitutes for toxic mercury in various applications.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While gallium isn't found freely in nature, it exists in trace
            amounts within minerals like zinc ores and bauxite. Extracting it
            involves complex processes, but its unique properties make it a
            valuable element for various technological advancements.

          The tale of gallium begins not with its discovery, but with a
          remarkable prediction. In 1871, the visionary chemist Dmitri
          Mendeleev, armed with his newly developed periodic table, predicted
          the existence of an element yet to be found. He named it
          "eka-aluminum" due to its expected position below aluminum in the
          table. Remarkably, he even predicted its properties, including its
          atomic weight and density.

              Four years later, in 1875, French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de
              Boisbaudran stumbled upon the missing element while analyzing zinc
              ore. Using a technique called spectroscopy, he observed a unique
              violet line in the element's spectrum, confirming its presence. He
              named the element "gallium" after his native land, Gaul, in Latin.

          While neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe, it's
          surprisingly scarce on Earth. Our primary source for this vibrant gas
          comes from fractional distillation of liquefied air. This process
          separates various gases present in air, including nitrogen, helium,
          and neon. Despite its low concentration, this method efficiently
          extracts enough neon to meet our diverse needs, from illuminating
