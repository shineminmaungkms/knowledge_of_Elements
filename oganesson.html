            Oganesson, with the symbol Og and atomic number 118, holds the crown
            for the heaviest element ever discovered. This synthetic element was
            first created in 2002 by a joint team of Russian and American
            scientists. Its existence was officially recognized in 2015 and
            named after nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian in 2016.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its impressive weight, Oganesson is extremely unstable. Its
            only known isotope, oganesson-294, has a fleeting existence with a
            half-life of just 0.7 milliseconds. This extreme radioactivity makes
            studying its properties a significant challenge. Scientists have
            only managed to produce a handful of oganesson atoms, hindering any
            in-depth exploration of its physical and chemical behavior.

            However, theoretical predictions suggest fascinating characteristics

            to be a solid at room temperature and potentially exhibit some
            degree of reactivity. These unusual properties, stemming from
            relativistic effects, make Oganesson a unique and intriguing
            addition to the periodic table, pushing the boundaries of our
            understanding of matter.

          The story of oganesson begins in the quest to explore the uncharted

          Oganesson, the heaviest element known, currently lacks any practical
          applications outside of fundamental scientific research. Due to its
          extreme rarity and instability, with only a few atoms ever produced
          and a half-life measured in milliseconds, oganesson is not feasible
          for any technological or industrial use. However, studying its

          Tennessine doesn't exist naturally on Earth. It's solely produced in
          highly controlled laboratory environments through nuclear fusion
          reactions. Scientists achieve this by bombarding a heavier element,
          typically berkelium-249, with lighter ions like calcium-48 using
          specialized equipment like particle accelerators. This process creates
          incredibly short-lived isotopes of tennessine, which decay almost
          instantly but provide valuable insights into the behavior of
          superheavy elements.
