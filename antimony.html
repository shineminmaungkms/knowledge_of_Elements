            Antimony, with the symbol Sb and atomic number 51, is a fascinating
            element that straddles the line between metal and non-metal. It
            boasts a lustrous gray appearance and is found primarily as the
            mineral stibnite (Sb2S3) in nature. Interestingly, antimony
            compounds have been known and used for centuries, even appearing in
            ancient cosmetics like kohl.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            This versatile element exhibits unique properties. While it shares
            some metallic characteristics like its shiny surface, it also
            possesses non-metallic traits like brittleness and poor
            conductivity. Antimony is resistant to attack by acids and remains
            stable in air at room temperature. However, it readily reacts with
            oxygen when heated, forming antimony trioxide.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its potential toxicity, antimony finds applications in
            various modern industries. It strengthens lead in batteries,
            enhances the properties of alloys used in bullets and cables, and
            plays a crucial role in flame-retardant materials. Additionally,
            antimony compounds contribute to the production of paints, enamels,
            glass, and pottery, showcasing its diverse range of uses.

          Antimony boasts a remarkably long history, dating back to ancient
          civilizations. Evidence suggests its use as early as 4000 BCE, with
          fragments of an antimony vase found in Mesopotamia. Egyptians employed
          its sulfide form, stibnite, as the iconic black eye makeup known as
          kohl, famously used by Cleopatra.

            <li>
              <b>Strengthening lead in batteries: </b> Antimony is added to lead
              in batteries to improve their strength and durability. This is
              because antimony is harder and more resistant to corrosion than
              lead.

              prevent materials from igniting altogether. 4. Other applications:
              Antimony also has a number of other uses, including: Production of
              semiconductors: Antimony is used as a dopant in some semiconductor
              devices, such as infrared detectors and diodes. Safety matches:
              Small amounts of antimony are used in the heads of safety matches
              to help them ignite. Brake pads: Antimony is sometimes used in
              brake pads to improve their wear resistance. Ceramics and glass:
              Antimony compounds can be used to add opacity and color to
              ceramics and glass.

          Antimony primarily originates from natural sources, with the mineral
          stibnite (Sb2S3) being its most abundant ore. This mineral is found
          deposited in hydrothermal veins and can be mined from various
          locations around the world, with China currently leading global
          production. Additionally, trace amounts of antimony occur naturally in
          rocks, soil, and even coal and petroleum, contributing to its
          environmental presence.
