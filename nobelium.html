            Nobelium, a synthetic element with the symbol No and atomic number
            102, lives up to its namesake Alfred Nobel in its explosive nature.
            This radioactive metal, belonging to the actinide series, boasts the
            title of the tenth transuranic element â€“ meaning it doesn't occur
            naturally and can only be artificially created in particle
            accelerators.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Born from the bombardment of lighter elements with charged
            particles, nobelium's existence is fleeting. All its isotopes are
            highly unstable, with the most stable isotope, nobelium-259, lasting
            a mere 58 minutes before succumbing to radioactive decay. Despite
            its impermanence, nobelium has captured the curiosity of scientists,
            serving as a valuable tool in research on superheavy elements and
            nuclear physics.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While nobelium's applications outside the realm of research are
            scarce, its contribution to scientific advancement is undeniable. By
            studying its properties and behavior, scientists gain valuable
            insights into the complex world of atomic nuclei, paving the way for
            further exploration in nuclear science and potentially even future
            technological breakthroughs. Although nobelium itself may never
            grace our everyday lives, its role in fueling scientific discovery
            is certainly worth celebrating.

          Nobelium, element number 102 and symbol No, is a fleeting celebrity in
          the world of elements. This synthetic metal, named after the explosive
          pioneer Alfred Nobel, doesn't exist naturally. Instead, scientists
          coax it into existence by smashing lighter atoms in particle
          accelerators. Highly radioactive and short-lived, with its most stable
          form lasting a mere 58 minutes, nobelium finds no use outside research
          labs. Yet, its brief existence shines brightly in scientific
          discoveries, serving as a key player in exploring superheavy elements
          and the secrets of the atomic nucleus. So, while nobelium may never
          hold your phone or light your home, its contribution to scientific
          understanding is nothing short of explosive.

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          Nobelium, with 102 electrons, packs its atomic structure with
          complexity. Imagine a Russian nesting doll, with each layer holding
          progressively more electrons. The innermost layers, closest to the
          nucleus, are tightly packed with 88 electrons, mirroring the structure
          of its noble gas neighbor radon. Beyond that lies the heart of
          nobelium's identity: 14 electrons occupying the 5f subshell,
          responsible for its unique chemical properties. The outermost layer
          holds a final duo of electrons, completing this intricate atomic
          portrait. Despite its fascinating structure, nobelium's fleeting
          existence makes direct observation of this electron arrangement
          challenging, adding to the element's air of mystery.

          The story of nobelium is one of confusion, contention, and ultimately,
          scientific collaboration. In 1957, researchers at the Nobel Institute
          of Physics in Stockholm claimed to have created element 102, naming it
          "nobelium" after their esteemed namesake. However, their reported
          isotope with a 10-minute half-life couldn't be replicated by other
          groups.

              Enter the Berkeley team in 1958. Ghiorso, Seaborg, and their
              colleagues bombarded curium with carbon ions, successfully
              producing nobelium-254, with a shorter-lived 3-second half-life.
              Meanwhile, scientists in Dubna, Russia, also achieved nobelium
              synthesis independently. The credit for discovery ultimately went
              to the Berkeley team, who graciously retained the "nobelium" name.

              the initial 1957 claim was likely mistaken, and the true
              "discovery" of nobelium belongs to the Berkeley and Dubna teams.
              This episode highlights the collaborative nature of scientific
              discovery, where international efforts and careful verification
              ensure accurate conclusions. Today, nobelium remains a fascinating
