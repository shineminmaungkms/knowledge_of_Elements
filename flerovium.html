            Flerovium (Fl), element number 114, isn't something you'll find in
            nature. This superheavy element is crafted in labs by smashing
            lighter atoms together. First created in 1999, it's named after the
            Russian lab where it was born, honoring physicist Georgy Flyorov.
            But don't get used to it - each atom only lasts a few seconds before
            decaying.

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its fleeting existence, scientists are eager to understand
            flerovium's properties. Belonging to the carbon group, it should
            behave like lead or tin, but early studies hinted at something
            strange. It seemed more volatile, even showing characteristics of
            noble gases! More research is needed to unravel this puzzling
            metal's true nature.

            behavior helps us map the uncharted territory of superheavy

          In 1998, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia,
          witnessed a remarkable feat. Scientists, led by Yuri Oganessian and
          Vladimir Utyonkov, successfully forged element 114, later named
          flerovium (Fl) in honor of the lab's namesake. The process involved
          bombarding plutonium with calcium ions, producing a single atom of
          flerovium-289 with a fleeting lifespan of about 21 seconds.

              Confirmation wasn't immediate. Initial results were disputed,
              leading to further experiments in 1999. This time, two flerovium
              atoms were detected, boasting a half-life of 2.6 seconds. However,
              confusion arose regarding the isotope involved. Finally, in 2002,
              the team definitively connected these atoms to flerovium-289,
              solidifying the discovery.

              Today, four isotopes of flerovium are known, with flerovium-289
              holding the crown for stability at a measly 0.97 seconds. The
              element's existence serves as a stepping stone in understanding
              the "island of stability" theorized around element 114, where
              superheavy elements might defy their usual short-lived nature.
              While flerovium remains a laboratory curiosity, its story is still
