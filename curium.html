            Curium, element number 96, isn't a natural find on Earth. This
            silvery-white metal, named after the celebrated Curies, is forged in
            the heart of nuclear reactors. A true heavyweight, it boasts a
            density higher than most metals and melts at scorching temperatures
            exceeding 3,500°C.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its impressive physical properties, curium's most defining
            feature is its radioactivity. All isotopes of this element are
            unstable, emitting alpha particles as they decay. While this makes
            curium unsuitable for everyday use, it opens doors in specialized
            fields. In minute amounts, curium finds applications in powering
            spacecraft instruments and providing targeted radiation in cancer
            treatment.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            However, handling curium demands extreme caution. Its radioactivity
            poses significant health risks, requiring rigorous safety protocols.
            Nevertheless, research continues to explore curium's potential in
            diverse areas, from generating long-lasting clean energy to fueling
            space exploration. So, while curium may not be in your pocket
            change, it undoubtedly shines brightly in the realm of scientific
            discovery.

          Born in the fiery hearts of nuclear reactors, Curium (Cm) is a
          synthetic element that never graced Earth naturally. Named after the
          pioneering Curies, this silvery heavyweight boasts impressive density
          and a melting point hotter than most flames. But its defining trait is
          its radioactivity, making it unsuitable for everyday life. However,
          this "glow" finds use in powering spacecraft and targeted cancer
          treatment. Handle with care, as Curium's radioactive punch packs a
          serious health risk. Though not pocket-friendly, this rare element
          continues to shine bright in scientific exploration, holding potential
          for clean energy and fueling our cosmic journeys.

        <p class="text text-white">
          The nucleus consists of 96 protons (red) and 152 neutrons (blue). 96
          electrons (green) bind to the nucleus, successively occupying
          available electron shells (rings). Curium, named after the Curies and
          first synthesised in 1944, is an actinide and transuranic element in
          period 7, and the f-block of the periodic table.

          In 1944, amidst the throes of World War II, a scientific feat unfolded
          at the University of California, Berkeley. Glenn Seaborg, Ralph James,
          and Albert Ghiorso, armed with a cyclotron, crafted history's first
          curium atoms. Bombarding plutonium with alpha particles, they birthed
          element number 96, later named in honor of the Curies, pioneers of
          radioactivity research.

              But the curium saga wasn't a solo show. The fledgling element had
              an enigmatic twin, initially dubbed "delirium" due to their
              intertwined nature. It wasn't until 1947 that Louis Werner and
              Isadore Perlman, at the University of Chicago, successfully
              isolated pure curium hydroxide, solidifying its existence.

              News of curium, however, remained classified until after the war.
              In a rather unusual debut, Seaborg unveiled it on a children's
              radio show, marking a public shift towards transparency in
              scientific discovery. Since then, research on curium has unraveled
