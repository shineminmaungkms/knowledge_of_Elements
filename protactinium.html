            Protactinium (Pa), element number 91, lives up to its name, "first
            actinium," by bridging the gap between actinium and its heavier
            neighbor, uranium. This silvery-gray metal, though naturally scarce
            in Earth's crust, holds its own secrets. Highly radioactive, it
            readily reacts with its surroundings and possesses unique chemical
            properties.

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Protactinium wasn't directly observed until 1934, despite being

          Protactinium, element 91, is a rare, silvery-gray metal found in trace
          amounts within uranium ores. While intensely radioactive and reactive,
          it holds mysteries within its fleeting existence. Predicted before its
          discovery in 1934, this "first actinium" bridges the gap between its
          neighbors, holding unique chemical properties and offering glimpses of
          potential beyond its radioactivity. From tracing ancient ocean

        <h3 class="text-white">Atomic Structure:</h3>
        <p class="text text-white">
          At its core, a protactinium atom holds 91 electrons, arranged in a
          complex dance around a nucleus. Imagine 2 electrons closest to the
          center, followed by 8, then 18, 32, and 20 more in increasingly
          distant shells. The outermost shell boasts 9 electrons, including 2 in
          the "f" sub-shell, giving protactinium its unique chemical behavior.
          This intricate electronic structure governs how protactinium interacts
          with other atoms, forming bonds and exhibiting its diverse properties.

          For centuries, protactinium lurked unnoticed, hiding within the decay
          chain of uranium. In 1913, Kasimir Fajans and O.H. GÃ¶hring stumbled
          upon a short-lived radioactive isotope they named "brevium," meaning
          "brief." It wasn't until 1917-18 that independent discoveries by Lise
          Meitner, Otto Hahn, Frederick Soddy, and John Cranston revealed a
          longer-lived isotope and solidified the element's existence. This
          newfound element, named protactinium ("before actinium"), filled a
          missing gap in the periodic table.

              Isolating this elusive element proved challenging. Despite
              predictions from Dmitri Mendeleev in 1871, it wasn't until 1934
              that Aristid Grosse managed to obtain miniscule amounts of
              metallic protactinium. The process was tedious, involving repeated
              purification steps and manipulation of protactinium compounds.
              This isolation marked a significant milestone, finally allowing
              scientists to directly study protactinium's properties.

              protactinium today is in dating ocean sediments. Protactinium-231
              (Pa-231) decays at a known rate, and by measuring the ratio of
              Pa-231 to its daughter product in sediment layers, scientists can
              determine the age of those layers. This helps us understand past
              ocean circulation patterns and climate changes.

              abundant and producing less radioactive waste. However, this
              technology is still in its early stages and faces significant
              hurdles before becoming a reality.
