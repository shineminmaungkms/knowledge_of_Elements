          Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and is the
          building block of life on earth. On earth, carbon circulates through
          the land, ocean, and atmosphere, creating what is known as the Carbon

          Carbon was first formed in the Big Bang, the event that created the
          universe. In the early universe, carbon was mostly in the form of
          hydrogen and helium. As the universe expanded and cooled, carbon began
          to form through nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions occurred in
          stars, where the intense heat and pressure caused hydrogen and helium
          atoms to fuse together to form carbon. Over time, stars began to die
          and release their carbon into the interstellar medium. This carbon was
          then incorporated into new stars and planets, including Earth. On
          Earth, carbon is found in a variety of forms, including graphite,
          diamond, and coal. It is also found in the atmosphere, oceans, and
          soil.

              Carbon is essential for life on Earth because it is the building
