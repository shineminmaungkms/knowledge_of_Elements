            Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30.
            It is a silvery-white metal that is solid at room temperature and
            has a relatively low melting point. Zinc is the 24th most abundant
            element in the Earth's crust and is the fourth most common
            transition metal. Zinc is an essential mineral for humans and is
            involved in a variety of bodily functions, including immune
            function, wound healing, and metabolism. It is also necessary for
            the production of testosterone and other hormones. Zinc deficiency
            can lead to a number of health problems, including growth
            retardation, impaired immune function, and skin problems.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Zinc is used in a variety of industrial applications, including
            galvanizing (coating iron with zinc to protect it from corrosion),
            brass production, and die casting. It is also used in batteries,
            paints, and fertilizers. Zinc is a relatively safe element, but
            exposure to high levels of zinc can cause health problems, including
            nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Zinc toxicity is rare, but it can
            occur in people who take high doses of zinc supplements or who are
            exposed to high levels of zinc in the workplace.

          The keyword "Identity of Zinc" refers to the unique characteristics
          and properties that distinguish zinc from other elements. Zinc is a
          chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is a
          bluish-white, lustrous, brittle metal that is relatively soft and has
          a low melting point. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the
          Earth's crust and is the fourth most common transition metal, after
          iron, aluminum, and copper.

          Zinc is an element that has been used since ancient times in the form
          of alloy with copper (brass). Brass was found in various applications
          in ancient civilizations of Iraq, Kalmykia, UAE, West Indies, Iran and
          Syria.

              Zinc was also used for healing wounds by the Romans. Pure zinc was
              probably first produced in India and China in the 13th or 14th
              century by a distillation process. The element zinc was discovered
              in Germany in 1746 by Andreas Marggraf.

          The source of zinc is primarily obtained through dietary intake from
          various food sources. Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a
          crucial role in numerous bodily functions, including immune system
          support, wound healing, and enzyme production. Here are some of the
          primary dietary sources of zinc: Red Meat and Poultry: Beef, lamb, and
          pork are excellent sources of zinc. Chicken and turkey also provide a
          good amount of zinc. Seafood: Oysters, crab, lobster, and shrimp are
          rich sources of zinc. Fish like sardines, tuna, and salmon also
          contain significant amounts of zinc. Legumes: Beans, lentils, and
          chickpeas are plant-based sources of zinc. Nuts and Seeds: Cashews,
          almonds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are good sources of zinc.
          Dairy Products: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain zinc. Whole Grains:
          Whole wheat bread, brown rice, and oatmeal provide some zinc.
          Fortified Foods: Some breakfast cereals and other processed foods are
          fortified with zinc.
